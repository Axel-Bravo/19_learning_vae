    "This is a refresh on the `autoencoder` algorithm, the autoencoder algorithms have limitations due to the fact that the \"internal representation\" achieved at the end of the __encoding__ part, _does not follow any known distribution representation_. Hence we can not use it to generate proper new __similar__ (to the trained data). __Autoencoders__ are used for image _denoizing_.\n",
